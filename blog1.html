      <p1>When I was younger, I used to read all the time. Most of the books were angtsy,
        teen apolytical novels but none-the-less, they were books. As I grew older and got
        into highschool, I put down the young adult fictions and picked up memoirs.
        To this day, these and self-help books are my all time favourites. Below, I share
        the 5 books that have influenced me the most (in no particular order) and the books
        I'm currently reading.
      </p1>

      <t1>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>‘The Glass Castle’</b> by Jeannette Walls</t1>
      <img width="70"  src="photos/glasscastle.jpg" class="glasscastle">
      <p2>
        I picked this up in the '5$ a book' section of Chapters when I was 14. Now, at 18,
        this remains the greatest memoir I have ever read.  <i>The Glass Castle</i> follows
        Jeannette Walls along with her three other siblings during their unconventional and poverty
        striken upbringing with an alcholic father and a neglectful mother. Walls beautifully
        recounts her strength and resilency to become an esteemed author and respected woman,
        and to this day, I still think of her story.

      <h4><i>"Extraordinary."</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time </h4>

      <t2>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>‘Educated’</b> by Tara Westover</t2>
      <img width="70"  src="photos/educated.jpg" class="educated">
      <p3>
        I got this book for my birthday after one of my closest friends googled
        'books similar to The Glass Castle'. I didn't expect to love it
         as much as I did. In Educated, Westover recounts the memories of how she
          escaped her strict mormon family to pursue an university degree.  This
          memoir put into perspective that if people want an education, if people
          want to become knowledgable for the sake of themselves and society, they
          will get one.
      </p3>

      <t3>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>‘Outliers’</b> by Malcolm Gladwell</t3>
      <img width="70"  src="photos/outliers.jpg" class="outliers">
      <p4>
        <i>'Outliers: The Story of Success'</i> is the first self-help book on the list. Gladwell
        discusses the concept of 'outliers' -- the highest achievers -- and what makes them
        the most successful; what makes them difference than the rest.
        Gladwell mentions how people often focus too much on the personality of
        successful people, rather then the environment in which they were surrounded.
