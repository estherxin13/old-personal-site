      <glass>When I was younger, I used to read all the time. Most of the books were angtsy,
        teen apolytical novels but none-the-less, they were books. As I grew older and got
        into highschool, I put down the young adult fictions and picked up memoirs.
        To this day, these and self-help books are my all time favourites. Below, I share
        the 5 books that have influenced me the most and the books I'm currently reading.
